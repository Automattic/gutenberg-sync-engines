/**
 * Seeded workload generator for the sync-engine benchmark.
 *
 * A workload is a document of N paragraphs plus a list of ROUNDS. Each round
 * carries a set of (client, op, target) edits authored from the same
 * observed sequence, then delivered. Whether clients share a target in a
 * round is what produces contention: two clients typing the SAME paragraph
 * field concurrently escalate (the second loses the one-sided-transform
 * race); typing DIFFERENT paragraphs merges clean. Scenarios pick that mix,
 * so the quality metric has a controllable escalation rate to report.
 *
 * Five operations:
 *
 * - `text` — insert a unique token at offset 0 of a paragraph's content
 *   field (a keystroke batch). Targets a genesis paragraph by index, or,
 *   in `remove-contention`, an inserted block by `block_id`.
 * - `attr` — set a genesis paragraph's align register (a restyle).
 * - `set_property` — set an entity-property register (slug, template, …)
 *   on the document itself, the field-sync traffic PR #22 added. Names
 *   come from PROPERTY_PALETTE: scalar registers that every engine's
 *   session codec carries as a plain last-writer register (title/excerpt
 *   are deliberately absent — the CRDT codec models them as merging
 *   Y.Text, a different op class).
 * - `insert_block` — insert a NEW paragraph (its body is a unique marker)
 *   after a genesis paragraph.
 * - `remove_block` — remove a block the SAME client inserted earlier
 *   (`remove-contention`: any client's earlier insert).
 *
 * Structural discipline keeps the oracles sound under concurrency: attr
 * edits target GENESIS paragraphs only (identified by their
 * delimiter-terminated markers `Paragraph N;`, which are never removed),
 * and each inserted block is removed at most once. In most scenarios text
 * edits also stay on genesis paragraphs and removals target only the
 * removing client's own earlier inserts; `remove-contention` deliberately
 * relaxes both (a text edit may target an inserted block, addressed by
 * `block_id`, that ANOTHER client concurrently removes) and stays
 * decidable through the profiles' scoping rule: a text token is expected
 * in the materialized content iff its edit applied AND its target block's
 * final state is alive, both facts the dispositions already determine.
 *
 * The generator is engine-agnostic and deterministic: same seed, same
 * rounds. Each round's edit list is shuffled at build time with the seeded
 * draw (see shuffle_edits()), so which contending writer reaches the
 * server first varies by seed instead of always being client 0. The runner
 * binds each edit to real engine coordinates (syncIds, Y.Map handles, base
 * versions) at submit time through the authoring profiles.
 *
 * Rounds are plain edit lists by default (every ACTIVE client reads per
 * its `read_every` cadence). A scenario may instead emit
 * `array( 'edits' => …, 'readers' => … )` rounds to schedule reads
 * explicitly — how `editorial-session` models present-but-idle clients
 * polling every second.
